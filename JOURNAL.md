# Journal
Journal to keep track of my progress.

I want to make more 3D apps but don't want to become a web technology person bc I don't like JS.
There aren't many altenratives out there, I did some research and they all seem to be really dated.
I mean 3D engines like unity are great but the lag my computer so hard I can never use them.
I need something that makes it easy to render 3D objects without forcing me to worry about OpenGL.

### learning
I understand the 3D pipeline pretty good in terms of software rendering contexts, but know nothing aobut GPU rendering.

I did some research and here's the general flow:

 - Create vertexes and upload them to a VBO
 - Send them to a vertex shader, which runs for EVERY vertex. In this case it can do the perspective transformations
 - Tell the GPU to render it 
 - GPU calls fragment shader for each pixel that is "in the triangle". Return its color.
 - Fast because fragment and vertex shaders run in parallel.

### implementation???
To not waste my time with OS specific stuff I just decided to use GLFW and GLEW for GL extensions.
I'm gonna try to render a triangle now.


Just wasted so long to learn i needed 
`glewExperimental = GL_TRUE;`

Nvm that didn't work. Time to use GLAD.
